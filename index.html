Hey there! I’m Esteban — part creative, part builder, part mischief. I like turning chaos into sleek design and scrappy ideas into living, breathing products.

    let currentSong = 0;
    const player = document.getElementById("audioPlayer");

    function playPlaylist() {
      player.src = playlist[currentSong];
      player.play();

      player.onended = () => {
        currentSong = (currentSong + 1) % playlist.length;
        player.src = playlist[currentSong];
        player.play();
      };
